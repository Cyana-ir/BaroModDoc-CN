Hello and welcome to modding Barotrauma!

If you only wish to learn about the submarine and character editors, you may skip the XML section altogether.

This guide is a work in progress. If you have any edits you wish to make, feel free to [fork this repository](https://github.com/Regalis11/BaroModDoc) and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Regalis11/BaroModDoc/pulls)!
