# Conditionals
Conditionals are used by some in-game mechanics to require one or more conditions to be met for those mechanics to be active. For example, some StatusEffects use Conditionals to only trigger if the affected character is alive.

## Comparison operators
There are several ways to compare properties to values. The comparison operator to use can be specified by placing one of the following before the value to compare against.

| Operator                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| "e", "eq", "equals"                                   | Require that the property being checked equals the given value.<br/><br/>This is the default operator used if none is specified.                                                                      |
| "ne", "neq", "notequals", "!", "!e", "!eq", "!equals" | Require that the property being checked doesn't equal the given value.                                                                                                                                |
| "lt", "lessthan"                                      | Require that the property being checked is less than the given value.<br/><br/>This can only be used to compare with numeric object properties, affliction strengths and skill levels.                |
| "lte", "lteq", "lessthanequals"                       | Require that the property being checked is less than or equal to the given value.<br/><br/>This can only be used to compare with numeric object properties, affliction strengths and skill levels.    |
| "gt", "greaterthan"                                   | Require that the property being checked is greater than the given value.<br/><br/>This can only be used to compare with numeric object properties, affliction strengths and skill levels.             |
| "gte", "gteq", "greaterthanequals"                    | Require that the property being checked is greater than or equal to the given value.<br/><br/>This can only be used to compare with numeric object properties, affliction strengths and skill levels. |
